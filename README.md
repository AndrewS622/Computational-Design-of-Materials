# Computational-Design-of-Materials
APPHY 275 at Harvard University

This graduate course in applied physics served as an introduction to computational methods in physics and materials science. Topics were covered ranging from basic pseudopotential models to density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations were performed in Python on a Linux operating system. Code and submissions are included in this repo, including five lab assignments and a final project, in which a Monte Carlo simulation was used to examine folding of DNA origami structures. The labs are as follows: 

1. Lattice Constants, Vacancy Formation Energy, and Surface Energy of FCC Al
2. First-Principles Energy Methods using the Quantum ESPRESSO Package in Ge: influence of plane-wave energy cutoff and k-point grid size on energy and forces, lattice constant and bulk modulus, elastic constants and band structure
3. Stability Studies Using DFT: effects of pressure and magnetism on BCC and HCP Fe, phases of PbTiO3, and phase stability of CuAu
4. Molecular Dynamics: accuracy of integrators, calculation of melting temperature of bulk Al, scalability 
5. Monte Carlo and Energetics: exploration of convergence of the Ising model, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility calculations; nudged elastic band computation of activation barriers for atomistic processes using both embedded-atom and Gaussian Process-learned potentials
